# Install for Ubuntu 20.04

I use `Visual Studio Code` as my editor.

I just wants to learn some php syntax, so only php is needed.

1. install php on ubuntu with command `sudo apt install php`
2. install php support on vscode (at welcome page)
3. install extensions `Code Runner` on vscode extensions store
4. run php code with `Code Runner`

> You can also use `php your_php_file.php` on terminal to run a php script. The `Code Runner` is just run the command for you.
